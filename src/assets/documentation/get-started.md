Foodcep will divide all your products by categories to keep them on a more organized way.

The first thing you will need in order to start working with Foodcep are products categories.

Go to the menu **Products** and navigate to *Categories* tab.

Add as many categories as you need. Some examples for categories could be: dairy, cereals, meats.

You can edit or delete categories.

Now having registered categories you can start adding your products.

Go to *Products* tab on **Products** page and add products.

We manage two main concepts when we're talking about products.

> **Price** is the actual value you pay for each kilo of your product to your supplier.

> **Cost** is the actual value you need to spend to transform the product to sellable food. 

You will need to provide this information about your product:

1. *Product Name*
1. *Price*
1. *Waste Per Kilo*
1. *Category*

You will need to measure the *Waste Per Kilo* with your scale weight.

One example about this measure could be:
>Take a kilo of potatoes and peel every potato. Weight the potatos without the skin and substract the weight of the potatoes without skin to 1000 and you will have the *Waste per kilo* on grams.

We will calculate the cost of you. You pay for the skin but on this case, you don't use it so we need to cover that.

The products will be displayed on the table as you create them. You can edit, add or delete them as you need.

You can search on your *Products* list with the search bar on top to make it easier to find the products you need to manage. 

You can export the complete registre to PDF by clicking on the **Export As PDF** button.
