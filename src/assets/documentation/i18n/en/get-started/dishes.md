Create and keep tabs on all your dishes. You can create your dishes based on the products you have registered.

Go to the menu **Dishes** and click on the button *New dish* to create a new dish.

You'll be asked to set a name and category for the dish you're going to create.

Next, start adding ingredients to it.

> Use the search bar *(products finder)* to add ingredients. You'll need to provide the amount in grams of the selected product. The price of that portion will be automatically calculated so you can add it ot the dish.

While you add products the app will calculate the cost of your dish.

Once you have every product included in the dish just click on **Save** and your dish will be recorded. The dish will be displayed on the menu dashboard of the same section.

It's possible to edit the dish. Just click on **Edit** under the dish name and your dish will be loaded on the overview. 

> One great feature about **Foodcep** is that every time you change the price of any product on the *Products Section* every dish that contains it will be updated with the new price. The only thing you need to do is be up to date with the prices on the market.

Export the dish as PDF if you need to by clicking the *Export As PDF* button on the menu dashboard.
