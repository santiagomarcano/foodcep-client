You can make recipes for your registered dishes. 

Just select the dish, and all your ingredients in that dish will be displayed. You can choose the minimum amount of production of that dish you need to make and the app will multiply the proportions of ingredients for you.

Write the steps for your recipe on the text area and save it.

You can edit or delete the recipes too.

> All team members will be able to look and follow the recipes.
