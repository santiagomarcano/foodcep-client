Foodcep will divide all your products by categories to keep them more organized.

The first thing you will need in order to start working with Foodcep are products categories.

Go to the menu **Products** and navigate to the *Categories* tab.

Add as many categories as you need. Some examples for categories could be: dairy, cereals, meats, etc.

You can edit or delete categories.

Now you can start adding your products.

Go to the *Products* tab on the **Products** page and add products.

There are two things you need to know about your products:

> **Price** is the actual value you pay for each kilo of your product to your supplier.

> **Cost** is the actual value you need to spend to transform the product to sellable food. 

You will need to provide this information about your product:

1. *Product Name*
1. *Price*
1. *Waste Per Kilo*
1. *Category*

You will need to measure the *Waste Per Kilo* of every product. This is where your scale weight comes in.

One example could be:
>Take a kilo of potatoes and peel every potato. Weigh the potatos without the skin and substract that to 1000 and you will have the *Waste per kilo* in grams.

We will calculate the cost for you. Every part of a product that you don't use needs to be taken into account.

The products will be displayed on the table as you create them. You can edit, add or delete them as needed.

You can search on your *Products* list with the search bar on top to make it easier to find the products you need to manage. 

You can export the complete registre to PDF by clicking on the **Export As PDF** button.
